Privacy-first human traffic analytics. Distinguish real humans from bots and AI agents — without cookies or fingerprinting.
Signals — Human Analytics

Human Traffic Signals for the AI Web

Signals is a privacy-first, open-source toolkit that helps websites distinguish real human visitors from bots, scrapers, crawlers, and AI agents — without cookies, fingerprinting, or identity tracking.

Built for the modern web where automated traffic distorts analytics and trust.

✨ Why Signals Exists

Today’s web analytics are broken:

* 🤖 Bots and AI scrapers inflate visitor numbers.
* 📉 Human engagement is buried under automated traffic.
* 🔒 Privacy regulations limit traditional tracking.
* ⚠️ Cookie-based and fingerprinting systems are invasive.

Signals solves this by focusing on behavior, not identity.

🧠 What Signals Does

* ✅ Filters known bots and automated agents server-side.
* ✅ Collects lightweight human interaction signals client-side.
* ✅ Assigns a human confidence score.
* ✅ Logs only verified human visits.
* ✅ Provides human-only analytics.
* ✅ Works on PHP sites (including Concrete5).
* ✅ Runs on Cloudflare Free plan.

🚫 What Signals Does NOT Do

* ❌ No cookies.
* ❌ No fingerprinting.
* ❌ No personal data collection.
* ❌ No cross-site tracking.
* ❌ No user profiling.
* ❌ No blocking search engines.

Signals is designed to be legal-safe, transparent, and respectful.

🧩 How It Works (High Level)

1. Server-Side Bot Filtering
   Known bots and automated agents are filtered using user-agent and request patterns.

2. Client-Side Human Signals
   Lightweight JavaScript detects real interaction (time, focus, movement).

3. Human Trust Scoring
   Signals combines server + client signals into a confidence score.

4. Human-Only Logging
   Only visits that cross the human threshold are logged and counted.
